## Introduction to Webhooks

Webhooks in Paperguide notify external services of events like page updates. You configure them to trigger actions in tools like Slack or GitHub. This keeps your workflows automated and teams informed.

## Setting Up Webhooks

Access the integrations section in your space settings. Add a new webhook URL.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings" icon="settings">
    Go to space settings > Integrations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook" icon="link">
    Enter the target URL and select events. Test the connection.
    ````javascript
    // Sample webhook payload handler
    app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
      const event = req.body.event; // e.g., 'page.updated'
      const data = req.body.data;
      // Process notification
      console.log(`Event: ${event}`, data);
      res.status(200).send('OK');
    });
    `````
  </Step>

## Common Events and Payloads

Paperguide sends events like `page.created` with details.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Page Update Event" icon="edit">
    ````json
    {
      "event": "page.updated",
      "spaceId": "space-123",
      "pageId": "page-456",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "userId": "user-789"
    }
    `````
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Space Delete Event" icon="trash-2">
    ````json
    {
      "event": "space.deleted",
      "spaceId": "space-123",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
    }
    `````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Customize filters to limit events, such as only for specific pages.

<Expandable title="Troubleshooting Webhooks">
  <p>Check delivery status in the dashboard. Retry failed deliveries manually.</p>
  <CodeGroup tabs="cURL,Bash">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://your-endpoint.com/webhook \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"test": "payload"}'
    ```
    ```bash
    # Verify signature
    echo "$signature" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$secret"
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Expandable>

## Security Best Practices

Use HTTPS for all webhook URLs to encrypt data. Validate payloads against expected schemas.

````

Rotate secrets periodically. Limit IP access if your service supports it.

Integrate webhooks with CI/CD pipelines for automated doc updates. Monitor usage to avoid rate limits.

Webhooks enhance Paperguide's extensibility. Implement them to fit your needs.
